# Factorio-Stasis-Mine
Adds a landmine that when triggered takes everything near by in to a temporary stasis, with them becoming frozen and immune from damage.
Discovered as a byproduct of Effect Transmission (beacon) research gone wrong.

Mod Settings
-----------

- Control if everything or just opposing forces entities are frozen in status when the mine goes off.
- Control the time things are frozen for. Defaults to 20 seconds

Notes
------

- Things already in a stasis can not be affected by another stasis triggering. Only "free" things can enter a stasis.
- Inspired by the Protoss Stasis Trap in StarCraft 2, but adapted for Factorio.
