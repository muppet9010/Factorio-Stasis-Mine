# Factorio-Stasis-Mine
Adds a landmine that when triggered takes everything near by in to a temporary stasis, with them becoming frozen and immune from damage.
Discovered as a by product of Effect Transmission (beacon) research gone wrong.

Spidertrons have been hardened against the stasis effect and so is unaffected. They also won't detonate enemy mines of any type as default in Factorio.

Mod Settings
-----------

- Control if everything or just opposing forces entities are frozen in status when the mine goes off.
- Control the time things are frozen for. Defaults to 20 seconds

Notes
------

- Things already in a stasis can not be affected by another stasis triggering. Only "free" things can enter a stasis.
- Inspired by the Protoss Stasis Trap in StarCraft 2, but adapted for Factorio.
