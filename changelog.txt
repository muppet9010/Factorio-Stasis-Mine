Version: 20.0.5
Date: 2022-10-XXX
  Features:
    - Added option to enable/disable trains being affected by stasis. Defaults to affecting trains.
    - Added option to enable/disable spidertrons being affected by stasis. Defaults to affecting spidertrons.
    - Added option to set the stasis blast area. Defaults to the original 6 tiles.
    - Added remote interface call to apply a custom length stasis effect to a single entity. Details in mod description/readme.
    - Added remote interface call to apply a custom stasis area effect to a position. Details in mod description/readme.
  Changes:
    - Trains are now entirely affected when one or more carriages are affected by stasis (mod setting depending). Now a fully affected train has stasis applied to all carriages in the train and it is fully stopped and prevented from moving for the duration of the effect. This is as a partially affected train doesn't behave nicely and would have lots of edge cases.
    - Players are not able to get in/out of vehicles in stasis. This is managed by script and not permission groups.
    - Renamed mod to Stasis Weapons.
  Bugfixes:
    - Trains are no longer mostly stopped. They are fully stopped.
    - Stasis weapons don't show on bonuses lists as they aren't affected by weapon upgrades.
    - Stasis effect graphic will appear more centered on things (middle of selection box, rather than entities position).

Version: 20.0.4
Date: 2022-09-16
  Features:
    - Added Stasis Rocket (temporary graphics).
    - Added Stasis Grenade (temporary graphics).
    - Added mod startup settings to disable each of the stasis weapon types. This disables the technologies, recipes and item lists for the stasis weapon. It doesn't remove the items so they can still be used via other mods in game.
  Changes:
  Bugfixes:
    - Entity affected blue light is now done within script and not on explosion. This means a new timed light won't be added to targets which are already in stasis, leading to the light lasting longer than the stasis effect. Also means the light won't appear on any excluded entity types: spider legs and other stasis land mines.
  Info:
    - Licence changed.
