Now:



Future:
	- Add: mod startup setting to set the size of the effect. We can just scale up things in the data stage.
	- Add: add smoother looking graphics for grenade and rocket, although not quite sure what the design should be, hence current temporary graphics.
	- Add: setting if spidertrons are immune. I can't get the spider from the leg, so the area damage effect isn't going to work. Will need to do a surface scan around the effect area for just spider vehicles, but this would mean if a leg is in range, but the body isn't then the spider escapes. A larger area check may find spiders that don't have legs in the area. So maybe log the legs found and then do a larger spider search and then see which one(s) the leg(s) belong too.
	- Add: Lock players in/out of stasis affected vehicles. Rather than by permission just check if every tick and put them back in/out. Also show a message telling the player that they can't enter/exit while the stasis effect is active. A player can't get out of a disabled train, but can other vehicles. But they can get in to one in all cases. So disabling the vehicle doesn't help here.
	- Bug: add to info.lua and mod portal entry that its landmines, rockets and grenades.
	- Bug: hide each weapon type from bonuses if it is disabled.
    - Add: Look at making the stasis graphic per entity scale based on the entities collision box.
