Now:
    - If an affected player character is teleported the effect graphic and light should go with it.
    - If an affected player character gets in to any vehicle and they weren't in one before they should be ejected.
    - Check for overlaps between character and vehicle checking logic when both are affected. Remove entirely un-needed code, but sometimes overlapping code is fine as long as it doesn't fight with itself.



Future:
    - Maybe I can make a few different sized entity effects and then find a way to select one for use on each frozen entity.



Ideal World:
    - Change the affect graphics and light to be a series of separate effects. Then we can do the fade in and out for both. Also when we have to recreate them for teleported things we can skip any fade in duration. At present its generally ok-ish.
