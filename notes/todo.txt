Now:



Future:
    - Add: add a remote interface to create a stasis affect at a given location, size and duration.
    - Need a small blue light on the entities affected graphics. This will require changing them to explosions and making a more alpha'd image for just them. The smoke effect can entirely go then.
    - Move global.stasisLandMine.stasisAffectTime to the global.modSettings
