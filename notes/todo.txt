Now:


Future:
	- Bug: trains don't stay truely stopped (manual and automatic). They manage to speed up a tiny bit every tick from 0. Cars do stay at 0 speed.
	- Add: mod startup setting to set the size of the effect. We can just scale up things in the data stage.
	- Add: add smoother looking graphics for greande and rocket, although not quite sure what the design should be, hence current temporary graphics.
	- Add: setting if spidertrons are immune.
	- Add: Lock player in to a stasis affected vehicle. Rather than by permission just check if every tick and put them back in.
	- Bug: add to info.lua and mod portal entry that its landmines, rockets and grenades.
	- Bug: hide each weapon type from bonuses if it is disabled.
