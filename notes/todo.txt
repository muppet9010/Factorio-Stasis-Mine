Now:
    - If an affected player character is teleported the effect graphic and light should go with it.
    - If an affected player character gets in to any vehicle and they weren't in one before they should be ejected.
    - Check for overlaps between character and vehicle checking logic when both are affected. Remove entirely un-needed code, but sometimes overlapping code is fine as long as it doesn't fight with itself.



Future:
    - Maybe I can make a few different sized entity effects and then find a way to select one for use on each frozen entity.
