Now:



Future:
	- Add: mod startup setting to set the size of the effect. We can just scale up things in the data stage.
	- Add: add smoother looking graphics for grenade and rocket, although not quite sure what the design should be, hence current temporary graphics. Maybe just use smoother item graphics for the techs.
    - Add: Look at making the stasis graphic per entity scale based on the entities collision box.
    - Add: add a remote interface to create a stasis affect at a given location, size and duration.
