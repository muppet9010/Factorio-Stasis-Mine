Now:



Future:
    - Add: add a remote interface to create a stasis affect at a given location, size and duration.
    - Have frozen entity effect centered on it better. Maybe stick box or type will do it?
    - Maybe I can make a few different sized entity effects and then find a way to select one for use on each frozen entity.
