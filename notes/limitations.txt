Lights
------

At present the lights are done via rendering. Down side is that these lights can't fade in or out like an explosion can. But for an explosion we need to make a dedicated explosion just for the light, as the very long durations of the effect mean we need a very slow frame progression in the explosion to avoid the max frame limit (255).

The rendered lights are presently destroyed and re-created for a teleported player or vehicle. While they could have their position updated, you can't update the surface they are on. Also you can't move the smoke graphic effect. So for now we just recreate both. In an ideal world both need a bunch more development to make them truly smooth.



Stasis graphics Effect
----------------------

As we are using trivial smoke for the effect graphics it seems to be very transparent and nothing we can do about this. Maybe a different smoke type would let us have a more solid image. If not an explosion would, but they have big issues with durations due to a max of 255 frames.

In previous testing have a slightly more solid graphic was nicer, but as I couldn't make it support the longer run time its not worth pursuing now.
