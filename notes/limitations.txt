Lights
------

At present the lights are done via rendering. Down side is that these lights can't fade in or out like an explosion can. But for an explosion we need to make a dedicated explosion just for the light, as the very long durations of the effect mean we need a very slow frame progression in the explosion to avoid the max frame limit (255).



Stasis graphics Effect
----------------------

As we are using trivial smoke for the effect graphics it seems to be very transparent and nothing we can do about this. Maybe a different smoke type would let us have a more solid image. If not an explosion would, but they have big issues with durations due to a max of 255 frames.

In previous testing have a slightly more solid graphic was nicer, but as I couldn't make it support the longer run time its not worth pursuing now.
